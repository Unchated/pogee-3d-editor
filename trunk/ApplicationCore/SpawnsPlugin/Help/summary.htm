    <h1>Spawns Plugin</h1>
    <p>The spawns plugin currently provides a means for editing of the spawn2 database table within a three dimensional environment. 
            This plugin is properly installed if a ribbon tab labeled "Spawns"  is present in the application.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h1>Usage</h1>
    <p>
    If the connection to a database is correctly configured then spawn2 data will be populated automatically when the "Zone" field is filled out within the ribbon tab.  
    If the database connection cannot be established then the working state will be considered offline.  
    In the offline state, any data that is normally pulled from the database (next table id fields, etc) will be improvised and will possibly clash with a populated database if the query is later performed.
   </p>

    <p> Currently only read access is required for database operations, there is currently not an option to commit generated queries directly to the database, primarily for safety and testing reasons.</p>

    <h1>Controls within the 3D environment</h1>
    <div>
       <p>LMB - select closest spawn</p>             
       <p>LSHIFT+LMB - a new spawn will be created at the location clicked</p>
       <p>LCTRL+LMB - with a spawn selected this will cause the spawn selected to face the clicked direction </p>
       <p>LALT+LMB - with a spawn selected this will move the spawn to the location clicked</p>
